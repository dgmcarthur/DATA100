# Data Science Reflection #2
Big Data is undoubtedly one of the most important elements advancing scientific analysis and technology today. The sheer amount of data that can be collected on humans and the world as a whole is astounding. As Kitchen explains, “Big Data is characterized by being generated continuously, seeking to be exhaustive and fine-grained in scope, and flexible and scalable in its production” (2). The data collected includes minute details on human behavior and interactions on such a broad scale. Because of this combination of detail and scale, big data is changing trends in the scientific community. As Chris Anderson explains in his article, “with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves”. If people click an advertisement more when it includes music, then it should just be treated more-or-less as fact. Creating a model for this behavior would be too difficult and unnecessary. What he is leading to in his article is a shift in how we carry out the scientific process. With so much information being collected, it is practically impossible to generate a model to encapsulate every trend. Furthermore, Anderson claims that many models turn out to be flawed in some way. Rather than use hypothetical models as the root for analyzing trends, it is better to use the data as the basis and work deductively from there.

While there is some pushback in the scientific community, the importance of big data in all fields is increasingly being recognized. Disciplines that rely on the traditional scientific method now have access to much broader and more detailed information on human behavior. However, Kitchen suggests that simply employing their traditional methods of analysis to this new data would not be as effective as taking a data-driven approach. While the exact approach one should take with regards to big data is not determined, big data will certainly become one of the most important players in social sciences and digital humanities. Because of the sheer number of human behaviors that can be recorded and analyzed, big data can be applied to practically any field that deals with human activity. To ignore this role of big data would be foolish.

However, as Blumenstock explained in his article, it is still valuable to maintain a degree of skepticism. While Kitchen argues that data is free from human bias, he does not focus on how methods of data collection and analysis can be skewed and marginalize already marginalized communities. This is not to say that most data is flawed—rather, we must still refine our models of collecting and analyzing data if big data is to become the focus of scientific methods. The growth of big data continues to highlight how it can model human behavior. With so much information about humans, big data can find where different behaviors correlate and even predict how a given person or community will behave under given circumstances. Central to this broad application of big data is the data science used to analyze it. And because of the vast interdisciplinary applications of big data, data science is continuing to be seen as a key player in the revolution in science on the whole.
