# Data Science Reflection #5

The important task of boosting development and bettering the quality of life for people globally is fundamentally tied with data and data science. This is because of the major contributions that data science has in being able to describe and predict human behavior, development, and networks. While the use of data science in human development is relatively new, the progress that has been made shows great promise for the continued implementation of big data in development.

Many scientists view big data as the next major paradigm shift in scientific thinking. As the WIRED article explained, the sheer volume of data that organizations gather on human behavior reduce the need for traditional scientific models. The data collected on humans can speak for itself, which allows data science to stand at the forefront of understanding human behavior. This revolution in scientific thinking allows us to better understand the complexity of human development, as well as to better allocate the resources and actions needed to improve the quality of life globally.

Importantly, this paradigm shift is helpful in analyzing human development as a complex adaptive system. As Owen Barder explained in his lecture, complex adaptive systems are non-linear and therefore difficult to model in their entirety. However, data science allows us to better analyze the smaller components of these systems, which has major applications in human development. Understanding human behavior as a complex adaptive system, and coupling that knowledge with big data, will allow us to generate better models for human behavior and human development. Additionally, both the volume and the detail/resolution of data will allow us to scale up these complex systems and analyze human networks and relationships on a much larger scale. This would perhaps allow us to see how things like food production, infrastructure, job markets, government policies all influence each other and human networks and a massive scale.

While big data may afford us these opportunities, there is still reason to be concerned about big data. For one, some scientists disagree with the notion that big data is a major paradigm shift and that we should drop our current scientific and mathematical models. They argue that big data should instead just be considered another element contributing to our current scientific process. Geoff West provides the example of the particle accelerate, where much of the data collected was useless, and that it was only with the underlying theoretical mathematical models that they were able to make sense of the data and make a new discovery. While this is definitely an important consideration, it does not necessarily translate to the data collected for human development. Furthermore, junk data may be avoided by simply not recording it. This point aside, it is still important to consider who has access to what data and to review the methods of data collection. In Blumenstockâ€™s article, he outlined that the privatization of big data can lead to data being used for profit, which would likely not benefit smaller, vulnerable communities. Furthermore, individuals aware of data being collected may skew the data to benefit themselves, which would deprive resources from the more vulnerable. Ultimately, it is important to take all these factors into consideration and take a combined approach to implementing big data in human development.

These ideas of big data and data science may seem lofty and broad, but it is important not to forget the tangible outcomes of data science and understand where it can lead us. The data currently collected in underdeveloped areas is already helping organizations to analyze the complex systems and networks of human behavior and provide necessary resources to fix problems and boost development. Data science allows us to combine such specific pieces of data on human behavior, health, and quality of life, with geospatial, economic, and other outside factors to analyze and model humans on the individual level. Because of the volume of big data, this can be combined to analyze entire communities and even cities. Data science allows us to see which factors are influencing what outcome, as well as to analyze what resources will benefit which people. Relying on data science here allows us to work with communities and better see human development and behavior as the complex system it is.

Despite the potential flaws with data science, and despite the lofty rhetoric regarding the future of science, data science is proving to be the most important element in aiding human development and analyzing any aspect of human behavior. There will be lots of trial and error, but as our models for human behavior grow, and as the technology for collecting and analyzing data grows, data science (in combination with many other fields) will prove to be one the most important factors in improving the human condition globally.
