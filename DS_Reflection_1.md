Data Science Reflection #1

	Data science is undoubtedly a crucial element in the solving problems in international development. However, as Joshua Blumenstock describes in his article, it is not the “panacea” for the problems developing countries face. While he explains the promise of data science, he also outlines the pitfalls of it, as well as ways to move forward. Ultimately, focus should be devoted to resolving issues in both data science and human development in order to better tackle global issues.
Blumenstock outlines the potential promise of data science’s use in identifying areas where humanitarian aid is most greatly needed. He then goes on to describe the major pitfalls associated with the implementation of data science for these purposes. The first is that some data-driven efforts have the unanticipated effect of benefitting those who are already empowered rather than the marginalized communities in poorer nations. Secondly, the data used can be inaccurate or misleading. Third, the algorithms used to analyze data fail to accurately represent disadvantaged people in countries. Lastly, since lots of data are owned by private corporation, there is a lack of regulation in how the data is used. Blumenstock also outlines the potential ways to move forward and work around these pitfalls. He writes that new data should not replace old data, but rather be used alongside it to gain a broader picture of a particular issue. Algorithms should also be more customized for use in developing areas. Lastly, greater collaboration is needed across disciplines and companies in order better tackle solving international problems.
	When crossing human development with data science, I agree that good intent is not enough. Given the pitfalls Blumenstock outlines in his article, data can easily be distorted by the wealthier individuals of a country, quickly become inaccurate, or be used by private corporation for purposes that do not benefit marginalized communities. Data science is, in its current state, clearly imperfect, and cannot be viewed as the one solution or perfect way of solving every problem. While transparency is certainly a major pitfall within this intersection, it is not the main underlying issue. With much of the data currently available, greater transparency would surely benefit human development in some ways. For example, companies could more easily collaborate and work towards the common goal of giving aid to those in need. However, greater transparency could also lead to manipulation in developing nations. As Blumenstock explains, in some African countries, people realized that satellite data analyzing their housing structures was being used to determine which areas needed more aid. “People caught on”, he writes, and some would “pretend to live in a thatched structure adjacent to their main iron-roofed house to become eligible for the aid”. Clearly, transparency isn’t the only issue in this domain. Ultimately I would agree that there is a careful “balancing act” that is needed to be maintained in order to work out better solutions to these problems. Yet this balancing act is difficult maintain, given the pitfalls in so many different areas both in data science and human development.
	Ultimately, I agree with Blumenstock’s main point that “the successful use of big data in development requires a version of data science that is considerably more humble than the one that has captured the popular imagination”. However I would counter that point with saying that work outside of data science needs to be improved. Data alone cannot give a full picture of the state of affairs in a given country. While data is indeed necessary to gain vital information about healthcare, poverty, environmental danger, etc. for so many people in large areas, it can also give a false or inaccurate picture of those threats. Therefore, I believe that the focus should still also be on improving methods in improving human development. I am not sure of what exactly those improvements might be, but they are essential if the goal of combining it with data science in order to solve important issues is to be accomplished.
	The growth of data science’s implementation with human development has led to greater strides in resolving issues internationally, and its future promise is great. However there are many pitfalls associated with it, and working on improving those shortcomings is essential in helping to improve human development. But the problems in human development also cannot be ignored. This is not to say that the current work is in vain. Rather, it is necessary to focus on improving both areas in order to provide the best solutions for developing areas.
