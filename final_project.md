# Final Project

## De facto human settlements in Hadxaifong and Xaysetha, Laos
![](healthcare2.png)
Hadxaifong and Xaysetha are two of the provinces that make up Vientiane prefecture. They also both sit just outside the capital city of Vientiane.
The population of Hadxaifong is 105,479:

And the population of Xaysetha is 98,391:

This brings the combined area's total population to 208,370. There appear to be 4 main urban centers within the total area, but the total number of smaller urban area seems to rise to about 17. Throughout the project, I had many errors and problems while trying to generate these plots, so the values for the densities are very high, however the color gradient still shows the relative density of these areas. The urban area in the northwest is the most dense, which makes sense considering it directly borders the capital city. It also has the highest population of all the urban areas. The next largest area in terms of population is the urban area in the south, which sits at the border between Laos and Thailand, however it is not as dense as some of the other urban areas. The remaining urban areas have much smaller populations but similar densities.

The roadways in the combined area seem to be strongly connected to the bordering capital city. The roads in the northwest mostly all lead to that capital city, though there are still roads connecting it to other places in the surrounding area. The urban area in the south only has one main road to connect itself to other places nearby. Although the number of roads may appear to be lacking, the plot only shows the major roads of the combined area, and not those that connect residential areas. However, I do still think that the area would be improved with more roads that better connected the smaller urban areas.

The feature that seems to need the most improvement is the area's health care facilities. The majority of health care facilities are located outside of the combined area and in the capital city. This may be acceptable for people living in the northwest, but the surrounding urban areas should have a greater number of health care facilities closer by. The urban area in the south only has three facilities in the immediate area, which is very problematic, as it does not provide adequate resources to many people living in this areas. The same can be said about many of the other urban areas throughout the combined region, who also do not seem to have great access to health care facilities. Furthermore, these areas do not have many hospitals or clinincs (blue and green in the plot), though they still do have doctors, pharmacies, and dentists (purple).
