Throughout the reading, Geoff West frequently compares the trends of human development to biological organisms in order to analyze development as an emergent self-organizing phenomenon. West leans heavily on the idea of scale to illustrate how the complex adaptive system of human development are structured and how they function. One major point in his analysis is that human development does not scale up linearly. Rather, development follows trends that are either superlinear or sublinear.

One example of this is in cities. West explains that city infrastructure scales sublinearly with size (with an exponent of 0.85), at a fairly constant rate across the globe. This means that as cities increase in size, there are fewer roads, powerlines, pipes, etc. needed per capita. West compares this to the metabolism of animals, which scales with an exponent of 0.75. West makes this comparison to show that cities, like animals, become more efficient as they get larger.

On the flipside, West explains that the socioeconomic quantities scale with a superlinear exponent of 1.15. This means that wages, wealth, crime, disease, etc. increase 15% above doubling as a city increases in size. This rate exists in tandem with the scaling of infrastructure and similarly highlights how cities become more efficient as they get larger. Essentially, the output of a city scales superlinearly. Both of these examples highlight the predictability of human development, which helps aids in our understanding of human development as a complex system. West emphasizes that investigating these trends is crucial in order to discover the main trends in human development.

A third example of using scale to better understand development is in our social networks. West explains how interconnected humans are by describing that any two people have roughly 6 degrees of separation between them, which is remarkable considering the sheer number of people there are. Despite this, West explains that the actual number of intimate connections a person has is around five, and as the links between people become more broad (i.e., close friends to acquaintances), the maximum number of knowable people for a person is around 150. This trend exists of most people across the globe, and it likely has its root in basic human biology. The brain can only maintain so many connections and stay involved in so many lives. West then makes the argument that the biological structures that dictate our social networks also influences the networks within and among cities. Because cities are founded on human interactions with one another, it is only reasonable to assume that cities were built in correlation with human neural networks. Again, this point reinforces the biological grounding for much of human development, and shows how there are numerous ways of understanding human development. West emphasizes the importance and relevance of analyzing the complex system of human development in this way so as to understand its complexity. In general, we can use scale to generate models to measure and predict human development, which can lead us to then generate better and more efficient systems.

Near the end of the reading, Geoff West comments on big data and its application in human development, as well as the theory that underlies it. In response to the notion that big data is the next major paradigm shift, West presents a number of counter examples and potential problems that go against this idea. For one, West presents the case that the introduction of big data does not necessarily present a new major paradigm shift, but as a new element in our current paradigm. West also emphasizes that correlation does not always equal causation to highlight potential problems of looking to data alone without any models. West goes further and says that, with unfathomably large datasets (like those for supercolliders), to look to the data alone, without any models, would lead to no useful information/discovery. Only a tiny fraction of the data is important in scientific research, and to abandon scientific models would lead to no further discoveries. West makes these points not to disregard the advents of big data, but to reinforce that total abandonment of our practiced theory is not necessarily the best direction to head in.

Personally, I feel that the conversation surrounding big data in general is very broad and seems to incorporate examples that might not be relevant. For instance, West’s example of the supercollider and the necessity of mathematical models does not exactly relate to human development, and I feel like it is an irrelevant counterargument to the push for science to be data-driven. On the other hand, Chris Anderson’s article in Wired talked about the data deluge in broad terms that did not discuss real-world applications of this kind of thinking. What will, for example, ignoring the scientific models behind linguistics and sticking to linguistic data get you? Overall, I think that the discourse surrounding big data is important, and I agree that big data is a major paradigm shift that will have enormous outcomes in all aspects of human life as well as in understanding and aiding human development as a complex adaptive system.
