How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?

Owen Barder defines development not simply as the combination of overall improvements in people’s lives, but as a product of the social, political, and economic systems of an area. Amartya Sen’s definition of development involves the general enlargement of freedoms and abilities of people in order to live a more decent life, and Barder extends that definition by comparing development to a complex system. There is not one simple, clear-cut path for development; rather, development rests and relies on the entire complex and evolving system that comprises a nation.

Question #2. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?

The toaster project was Thomas Thwaites attempt at constructing a toaster from scratch, where he would source and build every material needed to build a toaster by himself. He was successful in that he was able to build the toaster and have it work for a little while, but ultimately it went up in flames. Barder used this story as an analogy for complex systems. Building something as commonplace and (relatively) inexpensive as a toaster required a complex economic system, multiple manufacturers, different companies and manpower, etc. Similarly, increasing development is equally as complex and relies on the output of multiple different economic and social factors, political institutions, technologies, and so on.

Question #3.  According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?

Barder emphasizes how the last 50 years have seen the most success for humanity in terms of global development. However, he also stresses that traditional economic models have not provided sufficient explanations for why some countries seem to do well in terms of development and others continue to struggle. Ultimately a variety of factors contribute to economic growth and development, and discerning what causes a given change is difficult. Barder again stresses the importance of understanding development as a complex system, and he explains the failures of development to be from some problem within a country’s system.

Question #4.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?

Steve Jones was an evolutionary biologist who worked at Unilever to help design a better nozzle for making soap powder. He was successful in making a better nozzle, but the methods he used to design that model were extremely remarkable. Rather than try designing a model based on prior knowledge, he designed multiple copies of the current model, ran simulations on those models, and selected the best one to make further copies of it and continue the cycle. Essentially he was taking an evolutionary approach to the nozzle-making, which created a very good working nozzle. Barder used this example to show how technologies and institutions continually adapt and evolve with one another to form this complex and adaptive system.

Question #5.  What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?

A complex adaptive system is a system comprised of co-evolving adaptive social, political, and economic systems and organizations. Importantly, the behavior of a complex adaptive system is non-linear, and therefore hard to predict and model, as one small change can cause much larger outcomes. However, one still can predict elements of the systems behavior. Barder compares these to phonemona to the weather, where it is impossible to predict when a thunderstorm will strike in London, but that it is easy to predict what the weather will be like generally in July. Since these systems are also comprised of so many elements, it is impossible to say that particular agent is the cause of a given behavior; rather, that behavior is the sum of multiple other factors. Complex adaptive systems also grow more and more complex and do not trend towards equilibrium.

Question #6.  Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emporer exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?

Haile Sellasie was the last emperor of one of Ethiopia’s dynasties until its eventual collapse. Barder explains how all of the emperor’s top-down decisions exhausted the economic values of the nation and suppressed efforts towards a more inclusive system. Essentially, this behavior limited any kind of evolution in Ethiopia’s economy and institutions and, by extension, development on the whole.

Question #7. Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?

Barder explains that attempting to employ engineering as a policy implication goes against the general behavior of complex adaptive systems, which is that systems tend to co-evolve. Attempting to engineer a solution to a problem, like trying to simply engineer a new nozzle, will not be as effective or productive as the evolutionary processes that tend to shape complex adaptive systems. Barder emphasizes the importance of harnessing the evolutionary processes in order to best shape development. When Barder talks of isomorphic mimicry, he means that it is easier to mimic the elements of a well-organized and functioning system than it is to actually implement all the elements of that institution. These false-institutions do not have the same drive or power to effectively contribute a given system, which will ultimately hinder development.

Question #8.  What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

By warning to “resist fatalism” Barder is saying that we do not need to accept the results of the evolutionary processes of our complex adaptive systems. In fact, we can often shape these processes to produce better results. He uses the story of Norman Borlaug to emphasize this point. Borlaug intervened in the evolutionary processes of wheat in order to produce varieties with higher yield. This, in turn, allowed more wheat to be produced, which had the effect of saving countless lives that would have been lost to starvation. By harnessing and contributing to the co-evolutionary processes of a system, we have the power to shape the outcomes to be better.
